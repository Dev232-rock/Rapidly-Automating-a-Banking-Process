# Rapidly-Automating-a-Banking-Process
1. Rapidly Automating a Banking Process
Objective:

Automate the transaction dispute resolution workflow using AI and an API to prioritize and categorize disputes.
Solution Approach:

    Workflow Design:

        Collect dispute details via a user form.

        AI categorizes disputes and assigns priority.

        The dispute is routed to the appropriate support team.

        Notify the team with AI-generated recommendations.

    API Implementation:

        Accepts dispute details.

        Assigns a priority level based on customer history.

        Uses AI-based rules to flag high-risk disputes.

        Returns recommended actions.

    dispute_api.py → API implementation (Flask/FastAPI).

2. Full-Stack AI-Powered Customer Portal
Objective:

Develop an MVP for a self-service banking portal allowing users to check balances, apply for loans, and track disputes.
Solution Approach:

    MVP Design:

        Frontend: Mockups and UI wireframes.

        Backend: API to handle loan eligibility and user data.

        AI Logic: Determines loan eligibility based on predefined factors.

    API Implementation:

        Accepts customer details.

        Computes a basic loan eligibility score.

        Returns a human-readable recommendation.

    customer_portal_mockup.pdf → UI mockups.

    loan_api.py → Loan eligibility API implementation.

3. Scalable Banking API - Transaction Processing & Consistency
Objective:

Develop a transaction processing API that supports debit, credit, and balance inquiry operations with high consistency and performance.
Solution Approach:

    API Features:

        Supports debit, credit, and balance inquiry.

        Ensures atomic transactions (ACID compliance).

        Uses optimistic concurrency control to handle concurrent requests.

        Implements error handling for failures.

    Database Schema:

        Uses PostgreSQL with transaction logs for rollback support.

    Optimizations:

        Caching for frequent queries.

        Indexing for faster lookups.

        Distributed transaction handling for scalability.

Files:

    transaction_api.py → API implementation (Flask/FastAPI).

    database_schema.sql → SQL schema for transaction management.

4. Backend API Design - Rate Limiting
Objective:

Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent abuse while ensuring seamless transaction processing.
Solution Approach:

    Approach 1: Token Bucket Algorithm

        Maintains a bucket of tokens replenished at a fixed rate.

        Ensures smooth request handling without sudden blocking.

    Approach 2: Sliding Window Log

        Logs request timestamps in a rolling window.

        Dynamically adjusts limits based on real-time activity.

    API Implementation:

        Limits each user to 5 requests per second.

        Uses Redis for efficient tracking.

Files:

    rate_limiter.py → Implementation of rate-limiting logic.

    rate_limit_comparison.md → Trade-offs between different rate-limiting approaches.

Setup & Installation
Requirements:
    Python 3.8+
    Flask / FastAPI
    PostgreSQL
    Redis (for rate-limiting)

Installation:

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the API (Example: Dispute Resolution)
python dispute_api.py

API Endpoints
